# asdf-gopass

[Gopass](https://github.com/gopasspw/gopass) plugin for the
[asdf version manager](https://asdf-vm.com).

This plugin installs Gopass. The password manager for the command line. This
plugin simply installs the binary. It does not setup shell auto completion nor
installs required OS dependencies.

## Dependencies

Gopass needs some external programs to work:

- `gpg` - [GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/), preferably in Version 2 or later.
- `git` - [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/), any Version should be OK.

It is recommended to have either `rng-tools` or `haveged` installed to speed up
key generation if these are available for your platform.

For more information see
