# About

This is an asdf plugin for the [Flatbuffers](https://flatbuffers.dev) compiler by Google.

On Intel & ARM Mac systems, as well as Linux, this plugin will attempt to install the precompiled binaries from Flatbuffers' GitHub releases. If this fails, it will build the compiler from source.

Unlike most asdf plugins, this particular plugin downloads _zip archives_ from GitHub (not tarballs), and so `unzip` is required.

# Dependencies

- `bash`, `curl`, `unzip`: generic POSIX utilities.
- `cmake`, `make`: used to build from source on unsupported systems

# Install

Plugin:

```shell
asdf plugin add flatc
# or
asdf plugin add flatc https://github.com/TheOpenDictionary/asdf-flatc.git
```

flatc:

```shell
# Show all installable versions
asdf list-all flatc

# Install specific version
asdf install flatc latest

# Set a version globally (on your ~/.tool-versions file)
asdf global flatc latest

# Now flatc commands are available
flatc --version
```

Check [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) readme for more instructions on how to
install & manage versions.
