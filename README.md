websocat:

*WARNING*: due to release naming changes in the source project this plugin only supports releases `v1.10.0` or higher.

However, as a work-around for version issues or platform detection failure, you can override the "target" part of the URL below
by setting the environment variable `ASDF_WEBSOCAT_DISTRO` to the desired target. Platform auto-detection is difficult and there
might be bugs here - please raise an issue on GitHub if yours is detected incorrectly.

```shell
"$GH_REPO/releases/download/v${version}/${target}"
```

```shell
# Show all installable versions
asdf list-all websocat

# Install specific version
asdf install websocat latest

# Set a version globally (on your ~/.tool-versions file)
asdf global websocat latest

# Now websocat commands are available
websocat --version
```

Check [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) readme for more instructions on how to
install & manage versions.
